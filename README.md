Expense Entry: Input details of expenses, including date, category, and amount.
Expense Listing: View all entered expenses with sorting and filtering options.
Category-wise Summation: Calculate and display total expenses for each category.
Persistence: Save and load expense data to/from files to maintain data across sessions.


Objectives
Strengthen understanding of core Java concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, exception handling).
Implement data structures and algorithms for effective data management.
Develop a simple, intuitive user interface.
Utilize file I/O operations for data persistence.
Implement robust error handling to enhance application reliability.
